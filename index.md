I haven't quite decided what will live here yet. In an ideal world,
this site will host articles and podcasts to help programmers of all
skill levels. I have some buddies that I plan to pester for content ...

* [Joseph Hall](https://twitter.com/groundh0g) - author, game programmer, artist, ... That's me!
* [Steven Lowe](https://twitter.com/StevenALowe) - author, programmer, entrepreneur, ...
* [Andrew Rollings](https://twitter.com/hiive) - author, game programmer, ...
* [Jeremy Geiger](https://twitter.com/Metroknow) - writer, artist, ...
* [Scott Escue](https://twitter.com/Carth3l) - programmer, ...
* [Steven Jones](https://twitter.com/verbenatiger) - programmer, ...
* [Glenn Lanier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennlanier) - programmer, ...
* [Mark Lawrence](https://twitter.com/marklawrence72) - programmer, ...
* [Michelle Yost](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42287845) - DBA, ...
* Maybe some folks from [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/)?
* Maybe some folks from [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/)?

... and I'd love to do interviews with some of the big names in the industry. Heck, 
there are several lesser-known developers that I'd like to interview as well (because
I like their work).

## A Note on Tech

My other sites are powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), backed by a 
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database.

* [Fauxcabulary](http://www.fauxcabulary.org/) - my pun-a-day blog.
* [Codetopia, LLC](http://www.codetopia.com/) - my company site.
* [GrowYourKnow](http://www.growyourknow.com/) - my "I'll get to it eventually" site.

But, this website is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using the 
[JekyllBootstrap theme](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), and hosted on 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Here are some [other Jekyll websites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).

## Thanks

Thanks for stopping by. Expect more content here soonish.
